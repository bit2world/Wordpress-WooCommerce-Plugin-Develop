Product Information Card
Integrate with API for 3rd Party Service

This is a finished example of a WordPress app featuring a custom built theme where the theme is built using JS and CSS from the Bootstrap v4. Instructions provided are specific to using Mac ecosystem. I tried to provide relevant links to explanations for Windows users regarding WAMP vs MAMP, but some setup steps may differ. However, all PHP, HTML, CSS, JS code for creating the theme is platform independent and will be the same for both Mac and Windows users.
